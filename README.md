# Go Design Patterns

This project showcases various design patterns
implemented in the Go programming language. Whether you’re a beginner or an experienced developer, this resource will help you understand, implement, and apply design patterns effectively.

### Motivation:
Following to my previous repository [Design Patterns in Java](https://github.com/metao1/java-8-21/blob/master/src/com/metao/examples/designpatterns), I decided to create a similar repository for Go programming language.

    •	Write better, more maintainable code.
	•	Understand and apply design patterns in a Go idiomatic way.
	•	Collaborate and share knowledge as they build robust software.

|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Decorator Pattern**     | Dynamically adds responsibilities or behaviors to objects at runtime.      | ✅ Implemented | [Go to Section](/decorator/README.md) |
| **Singleton Pattern**     | Ensures only one instance of a class exists globally.                      | ⏳ Coming Soon | [Coming Soon](#2-coming-soon)         |
| **Factory Pattern**       | Provides an interface for creating objects without specifying their types. | ⏳ Coming Soon | [Coming Soon](#2-coming-soon)         |
| **Builder Pattern**       | Constructs complex objects step by step.                                   | ⏳ Coming Soon | [Coming Soon](#2-coming-soon)         |

## **2. Coming Soon**

This repository will soon include the following design patterns:

### **Singleton Pattern**
- **Purpose:** Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access.
- **Example Use Case:** Database connection pools, configuration managers.

### **Factory Pattern**
- **Purpose:** Abstract object creation to improve flexibility and decouple implementation details.
- **Example Use Case:** Creating objects dynamically based on runtime conditions.

### **Builder Pattern**
- **Purpose:** Construct complex objects in a step-by-step manner while maintaining immutability.
- **Example Use Case:** Building configuration objects or complex data structures.

### **Observer Pattern**
- **Purpose:** Automatically notify and update dependent objects when a subject changes its state.
- **Example Use Case:** Event-driven systems or UI frameworks.

### **Strategy Pattern**
- **Purpose:** Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate them, and make them interchangeable.
- **Example Use Case:** Sorting strategies, payment methods in e-commerce.

### **Adapter Pattern**
- **Purpose:** Convert an interface into another interface that a client expects.
- **Example Use Case:** Bridging legacy code with modern APIs.
